## Adding a new model to the project

To add a new model to the project, you need to create a model ts file into `src/models` directory.

Each model contains `interface`, `schema` and `props` to return on diferrent queries.

## Creating the file

You can manually define the `.ts` file or use `File Templates` in intellij IDE.

You can get the file template from [here](file_templates/model_file_template.txt) and add it to your ide file templates.
