# üçæ [NovaDating TelegramWebApp](http://t.me/NovaDatingBot/app)

This repository is the front-end source code of the telegram web app [@NovaDatingBot](https://t.me/TeleDatingBot).

You can also find the [**BACK-END SOURCE CODE** here](https://github.com/Sina-KH/Nova-Dating-Service).

This bot is written as a mini-app for [Telegram Mini-App Contest](https://t.me/contest/327).
It is developed and submitted as a dating mini-app for this contest and lets its users find their ideal friends/partner~~s~~ with mutual interests.

Feel free to use this source code as your new project's template. I tried to develop it as easy to understand and clear, as I could. It is NOT over-engineered at all!
